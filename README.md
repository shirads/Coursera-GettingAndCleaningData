# Getting and Cleaning Data Project (Peer Assessments)
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate out ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

### Goal
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. To do so, we will be required to submit

	1. A tidy data set as described below
	2. A link to a Github repository with our script for performing the analysis
	3. A code book, called `CodeBook.md` that describes the variables, the data and any transformations or work
	that we performed to clean up the data
	4. We should also include a README.md in the repo with our scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts
	work and how they are connected.

### Dependent libraries
`run_analysis.R` depends on two libraries: `data.table` and `reshape2`. It is assumed that you have already downloaded the packages. Othewise, download/install the libraries using `install.packages("data.table")` and `install.packages("reshape2)`.
